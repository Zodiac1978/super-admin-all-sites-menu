# Super Admin All Sites Menu

For the super admin, replace WP Admin Bar My Sites menu with an All Sites menu.

- Doesn't use `switch_to_blog()` i.e. it's faster and uses less resources than the WP Admin Bar My Sites menu
- List all subsites, retrieved using `get_sites()`. WP Admin Bar My Sites only list sites you where you're a local admin.
- Mark sites with [Restricted Site Access](https://github.com/10up/restricted-site-access)
- It's compatible with [My Sites Search](https://github.com/trepmal/my-sites-search)
- Add 'New page' submenu per site.

## Install

You knw the drill, download, install and network activate.
